# mwcog-phonegap-background-geo

- Initial code

* This now has everything in it (the cordova app, the platform compiled code). Doing this will speed up development; since we don't have to re-compile code from node-modules to platforms everytime we modify code. In the future, this will be cordova plugin's code only
